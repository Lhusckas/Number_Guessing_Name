Hello there. This is a project that I did to train my python skills.

The name of the project is Number Guessing Game.

It's a game that picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the user, depending on the difficulty chosen, has more or less lives
to guess the correct number.
This project was based on a similar project of a python course that I have.

It's a small project, but really fun to make.
